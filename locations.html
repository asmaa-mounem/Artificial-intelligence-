        <p>The problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been divided into a number of specific sub-problems. These consist of specific traits or capabilities that researchers would like to embody in an intelligent system. The features listed below have received the most attention.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
         
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reasoning, logical thinking, and problem-solving ability</span>
        </p><p>The first researchers in the science of artificial intelligence developed algorithms that simulate the sequential logical reasoning that humans do when solving puzzles, playing backgammon or logical deductions.
        
        In the 1980s and 1990s, artificial intelligence research led to highly successful ways of dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, using concepts from probability and economics.</p><p>
        
        For difficult problems, most of these algorithms require huge computational resourcesâ€”resulting in a "combination explosion":</p><p>&nbsp;the amount of memory or time needed for computers becomes astronomical when the problem exceeds a certain size.&nbsp;</p><p>The search for algorithms that are more capable of solving problems is a top priority for AI research.
        </p><p>
        Humans solve most of their problems using intuitive, rather than conscious, quick judgments, by step-by-step deduction that early AI researchers were able to simulate automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>AI research has made some progress in imitating this "sub-symbolic" type of problem-solving skills: the approaches involved underscore the importance of sensorimotor skills for higher thinking; And attempts to research in the field of neural networks and simulate the structures inside the brain of humans and animals that lead to the emergence of this skill.<br></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Representation of knowledge</span><br></p><p>Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering are the focus of AI research.</p><p>&nbsp;Many of the problems that machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge of the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are:</p><p>&nbsp;objects, properties, taxonomic groups, and relationships between objects; situations, events, countries, and time; causes and consequences; Knowing knowledge (what we know about what people know) and many other under-researched areas.</p><p>&nbsp;The complete representation of "what is there" is called ontology (a word borrowed from ancient philosophy), and the most comprehensive of these are called super-ontologies.
        
        Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:
        </p><p>
        Hypothetical thinking and qualification problem
        Much of what people know are "assumptions". For example, when birds are mentioned in a conversation, the human brain usually paints an image of an animal the size of a fist, sings, and flies.&nbsp;Of course, not all of these specifications apply to all birds.&nbsp;</p><p>John McCarthy defined this problem in 1969 as the qualifications problem: for every logical rule that AI researchers are interested in representing, there are many exceptions. There is almost nothing that can simply be said to be true or not in the manner required by abstract reasoning.</p><p>&nbsp;Artificial intelligence research has revealed a number of solutions to this problem.
        The breadth of logical knowledge
        The average person knows a large number of facts about the atom.</p><p>&nbsp;Research projects that seek to build a complete base of logical knowledge (such as Cyc) require massive amounts of ontological engineering -- they must be built in a traditional way where complex concepts are built one by one. One of the main goals is for a computer to understand a plurality of concepts to be able to learn by reading resources such as the Internet, and thus to be able to add to its ontology.&nbsp;</p><p>The symbolic subform of some logical knowledge
        Much of what people know is not represented by "facts" or "data" to speak of. For example, someone with chess experience avoids a certain position because it is "exposed or unsafe" and an art critic realizes that a statue is fake at one glance.</p><p>&nbsp;These are axioms or tendencies that are represented in the brain unconsciously and semi-symbolic. Such knowledge supports and provides context, for conscious symbolic knowledge. As with the problem of semi-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that AI or computational intelligence research will provide means to represent this type of knowledge.</p>
