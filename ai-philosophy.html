        <p>Represents artificial intelligence and is important to philosophy; For his claim to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind</p><p>This shows many of them:</p><p>&nbsp;Are there limits to how smart machines can be?&nbsp;</p><p>Is there a difference between artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence?&nbsp;</p><p>Can a machine have a mind and consciousness?</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
         
        <h3>Arithmetic machines and intelligence Turing's Law</h3>
         
        <p>If the device operates with an intelligence comparable to a human, then its intelligence is comparable to that of a human being. Alan Turing's theory states that, in the end, we can only judge a machine's intelligence based on its performance. This theory forms the basis of the Turing test</p>
         
        <h3>Dartmouth Thesis<br></h3>
         
        <p>“Every aspect of the learning process or other aspects of intelligence can be described so precisely that a human can design a machine that simulates it.” This assertion was printed in the dissertation submitted to the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, and represents the position of most researchers in the field of artificial intelligence.<br></p>
         
        <h3>The physical symbol system (the Noel and Simon system hypothesis for physical symbols)</h3>
         
        <p>“The system of physical symbols has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent actions in general.” The point of this sentence is that the essence of intelligence lies in the ability to manipulate symbols. On the contrary, Hubert-Dreyfus believes that human experiences are unconsciously shaped instinctively and do not depend on conscious manipulation of symbols; It requires a person to have a "feel" of the situation even if he does not have sufficient knowledge of the symbols</p>
         
        <h3>Searle's Hypothesis on Strong Artificial Intelligence (Chinese Room)<br></h3>
         
        <p>"A computer can have a brain like a human's if it's properly programmed with the right inputs and outputs." Searle responds to this assertion with his argument known as the Chinese Room, which asks us to look inside the computer and try to figure out where this 'brain' might be.</p>
